process:

set separate_counter to 0 on first day.
set an alza.csv file with initial scrape (day 0). Use this file to append new prices
run alza_get_daily.py
    Program scrapes all content from alza and saves it to
        alza_main.html
        "alza" + counter + ".html      (use to save data for future checks)

after run alza_test.py
    Program checks the separate_counter.txt and increases scrape number.
    Program creates a new name for export file. Format: dd.mm.count
    Scraping/parsing alza_main.html starts
    New csv file name is created dd.mm.count.cvs and all scraped and cleared data are imported
    Program compares all alza.csv products with dd.mm.count.csv products.
        Adds prices to correct row and columns in alza.csv
        All missing product prices become 0 and all new products are added to end of csv.
